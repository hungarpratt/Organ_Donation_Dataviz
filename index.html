    <h2>The Organ Shortage</h2>
    <p>
      In the United States today, roughly 100,000 people are waiting for a donated organ, 
      and thousands die each year before a matching organ becomes available. Today, all 
      fifty states offer applicants for drivers licenses the option to register as an organ donor.
      However, only half of Americans have chosen to do so, leaving the organ donation system
      woefully under-supplied.

    <h2>Media Misinformation</h2>
    <p>
      A spate of recent articles in highly respected publications have further exacerbated
      the shortfall. In Feb 2025, <i>The New York Times</i> published 
      <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/26/us/organ-transplants-waiting-list-skipped-patients.html?searchResultPosition=1" target="_blank">
        an article
      </a>
      questioning the integrity and equity of the U.S. donation system. Several 
      months later, the same paper published “Doctors Were Preparing To Remove Their Organs. 
      Then They Woke Up.” (Article removed from website.)

    <h2>Impact on Donor Rates</h2>
    <p>
      These articles prompted thousands of registered donors to remove themselves from state registries. 
      According to a

        target="_blank">
        letter
      </a>
      issued by the Association of Organ Procurement Organizations,
      “These stories have directly led to the biggest increase in people removing themselves
      from donor registries ever recorded, putting patients waiting for transplants at greater risk.”

    <h2>Insights That Elevate Public Messaging</h2>
    <p>
     To counter misinformation and sensationalized reporting, the donor-advocacy community needs 
     public messaging that communicates the truth with clarity and care. Achieving this begins 
     with a deeper understanding of why some people choose to register as donors in the event 
     of death while others do not.
    </p>
    <p>
      By examining the differences between these groups—and the beliefs that shape their 
      decisions—we can rebuild trust, strengthen donor-registration rates, and better 
      meet the growing demand for lifesaving transplants.
