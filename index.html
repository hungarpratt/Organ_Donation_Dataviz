    <h2>The Organ Shortage</h2>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.25rem;">
      In the United States today, roughly 100,000 people are waiting for a donated organ, 
      and thousands die each year before a matching organ becomes available.  
      Although animal-to-human transplants and living kidney donation are expanding, the vast 
      majority of organs still come from deceased individuals who consented to donate at the time of their death.
    </p>
  
    <p>Today, all 
      fifty states offer drivers license applicant the option to register as organ donors.
      However, only half of Americans have chosen to do so, leaving the organ donation system
     under-supplied.</p>

    <h2>Media Misinformation</h2>
    <p>
      A spate of recent articles in highly respected publications have further exacerbated
      the shortfall. In Feb 2025, <i>The New York Times</i> published an 
      <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/26/us/organ-transplants-waiting-list-skipped-patients.html?searchResultPosition=1" target="_blank">
        article
      </a>
      questioning the integrity and equity of the U.S. donation system. Several 
      months later, the same paper published “Doctors Were Preparing To Remove Their Organs. 
      Then They Woke Up.” (Article later emoved from website.)

    <h2>Impact on Donor Rates</h2>
    <p>
      These articles prompted thousands of registered donors to remove themselves from state registries. 
      According to a 
      <a href="https://aopo.org/aopo-statement-on-the-new-york-times-coverage-of-organ-allocation/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"
        target="_blank">
        letter
      </a>
      issued by the Association of Organ Procurement Organizations,
      “These stories have directly led to the biggest increase in people removing themselves
      from donor registries ever recorded, putting patients waiting for transplants at greater risk.”

 <article class="context-item">
    <h2>Leading with Insights</h2>
    <p>
To counter the misinformation fueled by these stories, the donor-advocacy community needs 
clear, evidence-based messaging. That requires understanding why some people register as 
donors while others hesitate, and how their beliefs shape those decisions. Addressing these 
factors directly can help restore trust and support the lifesaving goals of the donation system.

    <h2>National Survey</h2>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.25rem;">
      In 2019, the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), under the U.S. 
      Department of Health and Human Services, surveyed 10,000 Americans on the topic of 
      organ donation. The 2019 National Survey of Organ Donation 
      Attitudes and Practices provides a robust set of data upon which the following reports are based.
